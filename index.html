      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a depressed and autistic transgender artist who's also into technology. I'm an IT major with a cyber foresnics track and hoping that I'll start my career by being
        an intern and pray to god that they like me so much that they keep me and pay my ass because I honestly don't want to climb the corporate ladder to be on the 
        incident responce team. <s>If I can't get anything done I'll join the US Space Force and look at spy satilites because that sounds cool.</s> Update: im too mentally ill for the military ;-;
        <br>
        It would be even cooler if I get to work for the FBI or something like that but I feel like my online presence is too unhinged for a federal job.
        <br>
        I also working on comics! :D 
      </p>
      <h2>Current Projects</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Blood Boy</strong> — A horror webcomic about the US military and Lazarus Technologies doing too much "fuck around and find out" with 
            experimental super soldiers called "Spartans". The thing is the "biological" material isn't just some GMO or some other stuff, but rather belonging
            to a fragment of an eldritch god and oh boy they got him MAD and HANGRY and now they're just dealing with the repercussions of it all :)
            <br>
            Trigger Warnings: Blood, Violence, Trauma, Mentions of Suicide, People Smoking
           </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Future Projects</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Not in a particular order</i>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Shonen with a bit of Amnesia</strong> — A story about an alien named Tricia figuring out about who she is and was. The aliens are wacko and 
            OP. One of the gimicks of the story is that she has nigh-omniscience except about the aliens bc they do not belong in the universe, or any universe for
            that matter. Unknown when I'll start it
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rebirth of Mashtovekath</strong> — This one will be made after Shonen with a bit of Amnesia because it happens right after the events of Shonen with a bit of Amnesia
            right at the begining of Blood Boy (by like 17.5 years before the events of Blood Boy). Mashtovekath is the name of the eldritch god. The question is: who is the real person?
            The god Mashtovekath or the baby that is near to death when is given the gift of Mashtovekath's fragment that let it live on? 
            Is the baby's identiy Jason false or true? Hmmm philosophical questions~
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Some Murder Mystery Comic that has to do with cyber forensics</strong> — Idk honestly but its a thing I wanna do in the future
          </li>
        </ul>
