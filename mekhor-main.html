        <h3>What is this Setting?</h3>
        <p>
            Mékhor (IPA → [meχor] meh-HOR) is a planet that is similar to planet earth, with oceans and land and forests and deserts,
            and much like our own world it is diverse with many countries with their own cultures and politics and languages. I've did my 
            best intergrating nearly all of the creatures that are found in other D&D settings. I've decided to have this setting be completely free
            and if anyone desires to make their own content for this setting, just make sure to credit me, Alan P, for the creation of this world. Do 
            email me at <a href="mailto:alypompom28@gmail.com">alypompom28@gmail.com</a> if you plan to monetize it mainly so that I know that this does
            in fact is happening and this isn't happening under my nose. This will take me a while to complete this side of my website so please be patient.
        </p>

            In Mékhor, there is no such thing as common as a language because the denizens of Mékhor are diverse and sometimes that diversity comes at a price
            because some people just can't get along. The Elves have retained their common along with the gnomes, albeit with much variance with dialects, but the mountains
            that surround the Star Scar Sea seperates the humans, halflings, dwarves and other sapien creatures and thus each country has at least one language per race where
            the largest country, that being the Algera Empire, having 7 human languages, 3 halfling languages, 2 dwarven langues, 15 tabason languages and one aarakockra language.
            This is because the size of Algera Empire is 875 miles across from east to west and 750 miles from north to south. More details on the language mechanics
            of this setting is detailed in the <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Languages</a> page and more on the different countries in the 
            <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Countries</a> page.

            The best way to describe the diversity of this world is to describe what isn't in Mékhor. One thing that isn't in Mékhor are giants. Yes there are orcs and 
            trolls but the large humanoids that are the hill, fog and cloud giants and the like aren't found on Mékhor. Instead, they are found, at least mostly, as fossils in the earth.
            Most well preserved giant that was found is a frost giant that was found in the Larnav bogs. They are from a time of what is known as the ancient civilization of Necropia.
            To the denizens of Mékhor, these giants are a mystery of whether these were protectors, enforcers or gods in the time of Necropia; the only presevred history of them are of epics
            sung by bards through out the mainland continent. The Purple Worm also exists in the form of legends. Due to the fact that they're invertebrates, and gargantuan ones at that, it
            is hard for archeologists of the current era to find fossils of them, especially since they have never found a complete fossil of them. What remains are stone fragments of their fossils
            and the large 10 diameter tunnels they have burrowed deep underground that today is known as The Deep. There, life eventually started to sprout and became home
            to what are now known as the drow, the duergar, the svirfneblin, and the dernag who are humans that have adapted to the subteranian enviroment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most monstroseties do not exist in Mékhor either and the only ones that do exist are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cockatrices</li>
            <li>Darkmantles</li>
            <li>Driders (there is a evil spider goddess but it's not Lolth, she's similar to Lolth tho)</li>
            <li>Death Dogs</li>
            <li>Gricks</li>
            <li>Harpies</li>
            <li>Hydras (these are rare and are slightly mechanically different in Mékhor. In their native region they are known as the Zmey Gorinich or just simply Zmey)</li>
            <li>Hippogriffs</li>
            <li>Griffons</li>
            <li>Krakens</li>
            <li>Medusas (very rare)</li>
            <li>Manticores</li>
            <li>Owlbears (very common especially in the north)</li>
            <li>Minotaurs</li>
            <li>Worgs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, tarrasques did exist in the planet of Mékhor, but like the giants and the purple worms, 
            their existence is recorded in the rocks. This also applies to any other dinosaur beast like t-rexes.
            Those creatures are of legends and their fossils are evidence of such legends. Though if for whatever 
            reason you want to polymorph into a tarasque or a t-rex I won't stop you. You can make a rule that
            the player needs to know how these creatures look like first before polymorphing them into those creatures. 
            This is virtually impossible however, for a player or an NPC to polymorph someone into a purple worm
            unless they're Marquese Del Malvado the Necropian Vampire Wizard who is millions of years old and knows 
            EXACTLY how a purple worm looks like. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Aberations are also not common, but that doesn't mean they do not exist. Most sapien creatures do not encounter aberations except for aboleths which roam the Star Scar Sea.
            Most of the aberations, if they do appear, are from The Far Realm which a portal to it is in the bottom of the Star Scar Sea next to the divergent boundry from the tectonic plates.
            There, the water is heated from the planet's tectonic activities and life is supported. If an aberation that comes from that portal, it will have to be some sort of an aquatic creature.
